TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,98,One billion monthly active users of Entra.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,99,"16 billion Copilot interactions audited by Purview, up 72% quarter over quarter."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,100,And we took share across all categories we serve in security.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,101,"In LinkedIn, nearly 1.3 billion members."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,102,"And finally, in gaming, we expanded our reach across every endpoint, focused on our higher margin content & services."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,103,"We launched critically acclaimed games like Keeper, Ninja Gaiden 4, and The Outer Worlds 2."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,104,"Reaching 155 million monthly active users of Minecraft, an all time high."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,105,And set a new record for overall content and services revenue for the quarter.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,106,We also saw a great response to the Xbox Ally launch two weeks ago.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,107,And set a new records for players on PC.

TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,109,And we continue to increase our investments in AI across both capital and talent to meet the massive opportunity ahead.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,110,"With that, let me turn it over to Amy to walk through our financial results and outlook."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,111,I look forward to rejoining you after for questions.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,112,"AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. First, as you heard from Satya, we were pleased to announce the next phase of our partnership with OpenAI yesterday. They continue to choose Microsoft to power their workloads, and together, we remain committed to driving innovation that meets real world needs. Our Q1 results were not impacted by the deal signed this week."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,113,"Now, on to the quarter. We delivered a strong start to our fiscal year, exceeding expectations across revenue, operating income and earnings per share. We also saw continued share gains across many of our businesses demonstrating our leadership position in key markets."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,114,"This quarter, revenue was $77.7 billion, up 18% and 17% in constant currency. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 16% in constant currency while operating income increased 24% and 22% in constant currency. And earnings per share was $4.13, an increase of 23% and 21% in constant currency, when adjusted for the impact of our investments in OpenAI. FX impact was roughly in line with guidance."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,115,"Company gross margin percentage was 69%, down slightly year-over-year driven by investments in AI, including the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure and the growing usage of our AI product features. This was partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains, particularly in Azure and M365 Commercial cloud."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,116,"Operating expenses increased 5% and 4% in constant currency driven by investments in cloud and AI engineering, including compute capacity and AI talent to support product development across the portfolio. Operating margins increased year-over-year to 49% and were ahead of expectations with stronger than anticipated results in high margin businesses this quarter."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,117,"When adjusted for the impact from our investments in OpenAI, other income and expense was $401 million as interest income more than offset interest expense which includes the interest payments related to datacenter finance leases."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,118,"Capital expenditures were $34.9 billion driven by growing demand for our cloud and AI offerings. This quarter, roughly half of our spend was on short-lived assets, primarily GPUs and CPUs, to support increasing Azure platform demand, growing first-party apps and AI solutions, accelerating R&D by our product teams, as well as continued replacement for end-of-life server and networking equipment. The remaining spend was for long-lived assets that will support monetization for the next 15 years and beyond, including $11.1 billion of finance leases that are primarily for large datacenter sites. And cash paid for P, P, and E was $19.4 billion. As a reminder, the difference between total capex and cash paid for P, P, and E is primarily due to finance leases, as well as the normal timing of goods received but not yet paid."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,119,"Cash flow from operations was $45.1 billion, up 32% driven by strong cloud billings and collections, partially offset by higher supplier payments. And free cash flow increased 33% to $25.7 billion, with minimal impact from the sequential increase in capex given the higher mix of finance leases."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,120,"And finally, we returned $10.7 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,121,"Commercial bookings increased 112% and 111% in constant currency and were significantly ahead of expectations, driven by Azure commitments from OpenAI as well as continued growth in the number of 100-million-dollar-plus contracts for both Azure and M365. These results do not include any impact from the incremental $250 billion Azure commitments from OpenAI announced yesterday."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,122,"Commercial remaining performance obligation increased to $392 billion and was up 51% year-over-year. The balance has nearly doubled over the past two years. And even with this growth, our weighted average duration has been relatively stable at approximately 2 years."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,123,"Microsoft Cloud revenue was $49.1 billion, ahead of expectations, and grew 26% and 25% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage was slightly better than expected at 68%, and down year-over-year due to the investments in AI that were partially offset by ongoing efficiency gains as noted earlier."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,124,Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $33 billion and grew 17% and 14% in constant currency.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,125,"M365 commercial cloud revenue increased 17% and 15% in constant currency with 1 point of benefit from in-period revenue recognition. Year-over-year growth was driven by both ARPU and seats, with ARPU growth again led by E5 and M365 Copilot. Paid M365 commercial seats grew 6% year-over-year with installed base expansion across all customer segments, though primarily in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,126,"M365 commercial products revenue increased 17% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations due to higher-than-expected Office 2024 transactional purchasing."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,127,"M365 consumer cloud revenue increased 26% and 25% in constant currency, again driven by ARPU growth. M365 consumer subscriptions grew 7% to over 90 million."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,128,LinkedIn revenue increased 10% and 9% in constant currency driven by Marketing Solutions. The Talent Solutions business was impacted by continued weakness in the hiring market.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,129,Dynamics 365 revenue increased 18% and 16% in constant currency with continued growth across all workloads.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,130,"Segment gross margin dollars increased 19% and 16% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage increased, driven by efficiency gains in M365 Commercial cloud that were partially offset by investments in AI, including the impact of growing usage in M365 Copilot Chat. Operating expenses increased 6% and 5% in constant currency and operating income increased 24% and 20% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 62% driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier as well as improved operating leverage."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,131,"Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $30.9 billion and grew 28% and 27% in constant currency."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,132,"In Azure and other cloud services, where we continue to see accelerating demand, revenue grew 40% and 39% in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected growth in our core infrastructure business, primarily from our largest customers. Azure AI services revenue was generally in line with expectations. And this quarter, demand again exceeded supply across workloads even as we brought more capacity online."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,133,"In our on-premises server business, revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Results were ahead of expectations driven by transactional purchasing of Windows Server 2025."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,134,"Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year driven by investments in AI that were partially offset by efficiency gains in Azure. Operating expenses increased 4% and operating income grew 27%. Operating margins were 43%, down only slightly year-over-year, as increased investments in AI were mostly offset by improved operating leverage."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,135,Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.8 billion and grew 4%.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,136,"Windows OEM and Devices revenue increased 6% year-over-year, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong demand ahead of Windows 10 end of support as well as a benefit from inventory levels that remained elevated."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,137,Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 16% and 15% in constant currency driven by growth in volume as well as a continued benefit from third-party partnerships that was better-than-expected.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,138,"And in Gaming, revenue decreased 2% and 3% in constant currency. Against a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue increased 1% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, driven by better-than-expected performance from third-party content."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,139,Segment gross margin dollars increased 11% and 10% in constant currency. And gross margin percentage increased year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to higher margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 4% and 3% in constant currency and operating income increased 18% and 16% in constant currency. Operating margins increased 3 points year-over-year to 30% driven by the higher gross margin noted earlier.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,140,"Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,141,"Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total revenue growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we expect FX to increase revenue growth by 2 points in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. We expect FX to increase COGS and operating expense growth by 1 point."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,142,"Starting with the total company. We expect revenue of $79.5 to $80.6 billion or growth of 14% to 16%. We expect COGS of $26.35 to $26.55 billion, or growth of 21% to 22%. And operating expense of $17.3 to $17.4 billion or growth of 7% to 8%. Operating margins should be relatively flat year-over-year and down sequentially aligned with historic seasonality."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,143,"Now, other income and expense. The combination of OpenAI’s conversion to a public benefit corp and the ongoing nature of our partnership will result in increased volatility. Therefore, going forward, we will provide our outlook excluding any impact from our investments in OpenAI. On that basis, in Q2, other income and expense is estimated to be roughly $100 million as interest income will more than offset interest expense."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,144,And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,145,"Next, capital expenditures. With accelerating demand and a growing RPO balance, we’re increasing our spend on GPUs and CPUs. Therefore, total spend will increase sequentially, and we now expect the FY26 growth rate to be higher than FY25. As a reminder, there can be quarterly spend variability from cloud infrastructure buildouts and the timing of delivery of finance leases."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,146,"In commercial bookings, we expect healthy growth in the core business on a low expiry base when adjusted for the OpenAI contracts in the prior year. And we expect commercial bookings will be positively impacted by the significant OpenAI commitments announced yesterday. As a reminder, larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,147,"Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly 66%, down year-over-year driven by the continued investments in AI as well as the mix shift to Azure."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,148,"In Productivity and Business Processes we expect revenue of $33.3 to $33.6 billion, or growth of 13% to 14%."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,149,"In M365 commercial cloud, we expect revenue growth to be between 13% and 14% in constant currency, with business trends that remain relatively stable quarter over quarter. ARPU growth will again be driven by E5 and M365 Copilot."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,150,"M365 commercial products revenue growth should be in the low to mid-single digits. As a reminder, M365 commercial products includes components that can be variable due to the in-period revenue recognition dynamics."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,151,M365 consumer cloud revenue growth should be in the mid-twenties driven by growth in ARPU.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,152,"For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth of approximately 10%."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,153,"And in Dynamics 365, we expect revenue growth to be in the mid to high teens with continued growth across all workloads."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,154,"For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue of $32.25 to $32.55 billion, or growth of 26% to 27%."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,155,"In Azure, we expect Q2 revenue growth of approximately 37% in constant currency as demand remains significantly ahead of the capacity we have available. And while we’re accelerating the amount of capacity we're bringing online, we will continue to balance Azure revenue growth with the growing needs across our first-party apps and AI solutions, our own R&D efforts, and the end of life server replacements. Therefore, we now expect to be capacity constrained through at least the end of our fiscal year. As a reminder, there can be quarterly variability in the year-on-year growth rates depending on the timing of capacity delivery and when it comes online, as well as from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,156,"In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits with ongoing customer shift to cloud offerings."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,157,"In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to be in the $13.95 to $14.45 billion."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,158,"Windows OEM and Devices revenue should decline in the mid-single digits. We expect continued momentum from Windows 10 end of support, although growth rates will be impacted by elevated inventory levels at the end of Q1 that we expect to come down through the quarter. Therefore, Windows OEM revenue should decline in the low to mid-single digits. The range of potential outcomes remains wider than normal. Devices revenue should decline year-over-year."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,159,"Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be in the low double digits, down sequentially as growth rates normalize following the benefit from third-party partnerships noted earlier. Growth will continue to be driven by volume and revenue per search across Edge and Bing."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,160,"And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-single digits against a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party performance, partially offset by growth in subscriptions."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,161,And hardware revenue should decline year-over-year.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,162,"And in closing, demand signals across bookings, RPO, and product usage are accelerating faster than we expected. We’re investing in infrastructure, AI talent, and product innovation to capture that momentum and expand our leadership position. And we remain focused on delivering real value to our customers that results in durable revenue growth for the long term."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,163,"With that, let’s go to Q&A, Jonathan."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,164,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,165,"Operator, can you please repeat your instructions?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,166,"(Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on another outstanding quarter."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,167,"And if I’m looking at Microsoft, this is two quarters in a row, we’re really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody’s expectations when we were thinking about this company a year ago or five years ago. 111% commercial bookings growth was not on anybody’s bingo card, if you will. Yet, the stock is underperforming the broader market."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,168,"And the question I have is getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock, and it is something about to change. And I think AGI is a nomenclature or shorthand for that, and it’s something that’s still included in your guys’ OpenAI agreement."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,169,"Satya, when we think about AGI, or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it’s AGI or something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today, where that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis? Is there anything that you’re worrying about in that evolution, and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,170,"SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. Here’s how I would say that I think there are two parts we feel very, very good about, even this, I’d say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI, because I think even, it just creates more certainty to all the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,171,"But beyond that, I think your question touches on something that’s pretty important, which is, how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and then obviously, the providers of these systems?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,172,"And I think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let’s even say, exponentially, model version over model version, the problem is, it’s always going to still be jagged. I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence or spikey intelligence. You may even have a capability that’s fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,173,"What is required is, in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the M365 Copilot system. Don’t think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that, in some sense, smooths out those jagged edges and really helps the capability."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,174,"I mean, just to give you a flavor for it, if I am in M365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet. The good news is, now an expert spreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good model."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,175,"The more interesting thing is, I can go into Agent Mode in Excel and iterate on that model, and yet it’ll stay on rails. It won’t go off rails. It’ll be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the Analyst agent, and then it’ll even make sense of it like a data analyst would, of our Excel model."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,176,"The reason I say all of that is because that’s the type of construction that will be needed. Even when the model is magical, all powerful, I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,177,"One of the fundamental things that, whether it’s GitHub, whether it’s security, whether it’s M365, the three main domains we are in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,178,"And by the way, that’s the same thing that we want to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. That’s how people will build these multiagent systems."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,179,"I feel actually, pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don’t think AGI, as defined, at least, by us in our contract, is ever going to be achieved anytime soon, but I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building these systems. It’s the real question that needs to be well understood, and I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,180,KEITH WEISS: Excellent. That’s super helpful.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,181,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,182,"(Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Amy, on the bookings blow out, I guess many are somewhat concerned about concentration risk. And I think you noted a number of $100 million contracts. And not to go into a lot of detail, but can you just give a sense of what you’re seeing in that 51% RPO and 110%-plus bookings growth that gives you confidence about what you’re seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis. Thanks."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,183,"AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. A couple things to maybe take a step back on RPO. With a nearly $400 billion balance, we’ve been trying to help people understand how to think about, really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. And that’s been a balance that we’ve been growing, obviously, at a good clip."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,184,"But what people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya’s talking about around creating systems and where we’re investing. And if you’re going to have that type of balance, and then, more importantly, have the weighted average duration be two years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,185,"People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there’s value. And I think this is why we keep coming back to are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,186,"And so, I think the way to think about RPO is it’s been building across a number of customers. We’re thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We’re learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are being used at scale, that benefits every other customer."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,187,"And so, it’s why we’ve tried to get a little bit more color to that RPO balance, because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about, is it long dated? Is it coming over a long period of time? And hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order. And at that type of scale, I think that’s a pretty remarkable execution."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,188,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,189,"(Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. It’s pretty amazing, what you guys are doing."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,190,"Satya and Amy, I’d like to ask you the number one question I receive, whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend. How much confidence do you have that the software, even the consumer internet business can monetize all the investments we’re seeing globally, or, frankly, are we in a bubble?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,191,"In fact, Amy, what would be the factors you’d be watching for to assure that you’re not over building for current demand and that demand will sustain? Thank you."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,192,"AMY HOOD: Maybe I’ll start, Satya, and then you could add."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,193,"Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots, because with $400 billion of RPO that’s short dated, as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure is very high. And that’s for booked business today. That is not any new book to business we started trying to accomplish on October 1st."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,194,"And so, the way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular and as we talked about ‘26, the remainder, number one, we’re pivoting toward, increasingly, we talked about this, short lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs. Again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,195,"Now, when that happens short-lived assets generally are done to match the duration of the contracts, or the duration of your expectation of those contracts. And so, I sometimes think when people think about risk, they’re not realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetimes of the contracts are very similar. And so, when you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet and the depreciation of short lived assets, they’re actually quite matched, Mark."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,196,"And as you know, we’ve spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power, is the language we use, to put them in. We spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now, we’re continuing to do that, also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we’ve talked about, 15 to 20 years. And over that period of time, do I have confidence that we’ll need to use all of that? It is very high."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,197,"And so, when I think about balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPUs, CPUs, short lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are, and I said this now, we’ve been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We’re seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing uses very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real usage."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,198,"And I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely, is that you know when you see these demand signals, and we know we’re behind, we do need to spend. But we’re spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,199,"I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D, and we’re doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. We’re going to spend to make sure that happens. It’s about modernization. It’s about high quality. It’s about service delivery, and it’s about meeting demand."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,200,"And so, I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that we’ve been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,201,"SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, the only thing I would add to what Amy captured was, if you look out, there are two things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,202,"One is, how efficient is our planet scale token factory? I mean, that’s, at the end of the day, what you have to do. And you in order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible fleet. It’s not like we’re building one data center in one region in the world that’s mega scale. We’re building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for datacenter, what have you. Therefore, the fungibility is super important."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,203,"The second thing that we’re also doing is continually modernizing the fleet. It’s not like we buy one version of, say, Nvidia and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year, your buy; you write the Moore’s Law. You continuously modernize and depreciate it. And that means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-41 and 5o. That’s software."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,204,"And by the way, it’s helpful on A100s. It’s helpful on GB200s, and it’ll be helpful on GB300s. That’s the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,205,"Keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. That’s what you do in the token factory."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,206,"The other aspect, which Amy spoke to, is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high value domains. It’s in information work. That’s the Copilot system. Coding, I mean, I should also say, one of the things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPUs compared to M365 ARPUs, it’s expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud, we used to always say, “Well, is it zero sum?” It turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,207,"The same thing is happening in AI, because first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365, or you could say, we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,208,"Same thing with tools. I mean, tooling, this tools business was not a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems. And so, we feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security, same thing with health."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,209,"And in consumer, one of the things is it’s not just about ads, it’s ads plus subscriptions. That also opens up opportunity for us."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,210,"When I look at the entirety of these high value agent systems, and when we look at the efficiency of and fungibility of our fleet, that’s what gives us the confidence to invest both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,211,MARK MOERDLER: That was pretty amazing. I really appreciate all the details.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,212,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,213,"(Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, thank you. This one is for Amy."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,214,"Amy, I certainly don’t want to take you down too complex an accounting path with this question. But the investment in OpenAI that sits another income at $4.1 billion is so large that I think the audience listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like it’s so much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it mustn’t just be your share of the OpenAI losses."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,215,"Could you just describe that and what we can expect in subsequent quarters, and whether this signals any kind of accounting change? Thanks so much."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,216,"AMY HOOD: The Q1 number was not impacted at all by the new agreement that was put in place. Let me first say that. Secondly, that increased loss was all due to our percentage of losses and OpenAI equity method, just to be very clear. There is not anything there that is not the increased losses from OpenAI."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,217,"KARL KEIRSTEAD: Okay, understood. Thank you."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,218,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,219,"(Operator Direction.) MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you so much. We seem to be entering into a new era where the contractual commitments from a small number of AI natives are just incredibly large, and not only at absolute terms, but sometimes relative to the size of the companies themselves, for instance, contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are 20 times their current revenue scale."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,220,"Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability of those companies to follow through on these commitments? And how do you think about placing guardrails on customer concentration for any single entity?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,221,"SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll start and then, Amy, you can add."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,222,"I mean, it goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first the asset itself such that it’s most fungible, and then to recognize the strength of even our portfolio. We have a third-party business. We have a first-party business. We have third party also spread between enterprise, digital natives."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,223,"I’ve always felt that we need a balance there, because it may start with digital natives. They’re always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation, and then, essentially, it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,224,"And so, therefore, having over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase. But it’s great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning, because you can build scale that then, it’s a fungible. And that’s where the key is. You don’t want to build for a digital native as if you’re just doing hosting for them. You want to build."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,225,"That’s where I think some of the decision making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to? What do we say no to? I think there was a lot of confusion. Hopefully, by now, anyone who’s switched on would figure this out."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,226,"And so, that’s, I think, one thing we’re doing on the third party, but the one first-party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes. And it’s not even about one hit app on our first party, even. Our portfolio of stuff, which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us, again, the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,227,"And remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on, are long assets. There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when it comes to the gear."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,228,"I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,229,"AMY HOOD: And maybe just to help with another angle, because I think Satya has helped a lot, is that when you think about concentration risk or delivering to any customer, you have to remember that, because we’re talking about this very large, flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any purpose, 1P, 3P, and including our commercial cloud, by the way, which I should be quite clear on, it is pretty flexible in every regard, you have to remember that the CPU and GPU and the storage gear doesn’t come into play until the contracts start happening."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,230,"And so, you’re right. Some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time, so you get a lot of lead time in being able to say, oh, what’s the status? And so, I think we’re pretty thoughtful around what’s always gone in our RPO balance, and been considerate of that. There’s always been that taken into account when we publish that bookings number and publish the RPO balance."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,231,MARK MURPHY: Thank you very much.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,232,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,233,"(Operator Direction.) BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question, and I’ll echo my congrats on an amazing start to the year."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,234,"Amy, is there any way to quantify or frame the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? And while I appreciate the constraints you face are brought across the industry, is there risk of workloads going elsewhere, and how do you mitigate that?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,235,"AMY HOOD: Yeah, Brad, it’s a great question. It’s always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact in quarter, but I would offer a way to think about it, is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact, because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it’s obviously the increasing usage and adoption and sales we’ve seen of M365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot Chat, which we’ve seen very different patterns, which we’re encouraged by. It’s the adoption of security features. It’s the GitHub momentum."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,236,"And so, when you’re thinking about it, that is where, and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. And so, you are right to ask, how do I think about that? We’ve worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure. And we’ve been clear on it."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,237,"And I would say the other two priorities that I haven’t mentioned maybe as much before, it’s also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we’ve been able to hire into the company, really, over the past year and a half, have access also to significant capacity, because we’re seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit today, into products people are using today for real-world work."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,238,"And so, we are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that as well as our product engineering teams. And yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization, but I think it’s probably hard for me to give an exact number. But it is safe to say that the number could be higher."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,239,"JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,240,"(Operator Direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,241,"Amy, I just wanted to congratulate you. I think you said before that it is possible to accelerate Azure growth while getting efficient margins, and you’ve done it. Congrats on that."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,242,"I have one for you, Satya. With respect to the elephant in the room, just being a little bit more direct, following up on Keith Weiss’ question, there’s talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft’s. I’m sure that there is a different point of view here."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,243,"I’m wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria to, is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the Microsoft paper, or something broader than that, that I don’t think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being underestimated, as you have the full stack and you’ve got the multiple vectors to monetize, be it databases, Foundry, and to your point, that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler?"
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,244,"Maybe that’s what it is all about, or maybe there’s another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company come in from nowhere, and claiming a big piece of that four-to-five-year puzzle. Thank you so much once again, really appreciate it, and congratulations."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,245,"SATYA NADELLA: Well, thanks, Kash. I mean, for us, again, it just always goes back to, I think, the core principle, which is build a fleet that is fungible across the planet and works for third-party and first-party and research. That’s essentially what we have done."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,246,"And so, when some demand comes in shapes that don’t fit that goal, where it’s too concentrated, not just by customer, by location, by type of skewing, I think Amy mentioned some very key things, when you think about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you’ve got to remember this the AI accelerator piece. But there’s compute, there’s storage. And if so, if all of the demand just comes for just one meter, that’s really not a long-term business we want to be in."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,247,"That’s even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff, because that’s, after all, a different margin stack for us. And then we have to fund our own R&D and model capability, because in the long run, that’s what’s going to differentiate us."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,248,"And so, I look at all of those, we use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we want. We say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could serve, but it’s not in our long-term interest. And so, that’s the decision making we’ve done, and we feel very, very good about the decisions. In some sense, I feel even each time we say no to, the day after, I feel better."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,249,"KASH RANGAN: That’s fantastic, very clear."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,250,"AMY HOOD: Yeah. And Kash, I think this is our last call with you, and I just want to say thanks and congratulations. It’s been a privilege to work with you, and best of luck."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,251,"SATYA NADELLA: Let me add to that. Best of luck, Kash."
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,252,KASH RANGAN: Thank you so much. Very kind of you.
TranscriptFY26Q1.docx,253,"That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon."
