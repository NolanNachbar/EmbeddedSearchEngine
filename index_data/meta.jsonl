Powell Chair Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System at the 67th Annual Meeting of the National Association for Business Economics Philadelphia, Pennsylvania October 14, 2025 Thank you, Emily. And thank you to the National Association for Business Economics for the Adam Smith Award. It is an honor just to be mentioned alongside past recipients, including my predecessors Janet Yellen and Ben Bernanke. Thank you for this recognition and for the opportunity to speak with you today. Monetary policy is more effective when the public understands what the Federal Reserve does and why. With that in mind, I hope to enhance understanding of one of the more arcane and technical aspects of monetary policy: the Federal Reserve’s balance sheet. A colleague recently compared this topic to a trip to the dentist, but that comparison may be unfair—to dentists. 1 Today, I will discuss the essential role our balance sheet played during the pandemic, along with some lessons learned. I will then review our ample reserves implementation framework and the progress we have made toward normalizing the size of our balance sheet. I will conclude with some brief remarks on the economic outlook. Background on the Fed’s Balance Sheet One of the primary purposes of a central bank is to provide the monetary foundation for the financial system and the broader economy. This foundation is made of central bank liabilities. On the Fed’s balance sheet, the liability side of the ledger totaled $6.5 trillion as of October 8, and three categories account for roughly 95 percent of that total. 2 First, Federal Reserve notes— that is, physical currency—totaled $2.4 trillion. Second, reserves—funds held by depository institutions at the Federal Reserve Banks — 1 See Christopher J. Waller (2025), “Demystifying the Federal Reserve's Balance Sheet,” speech delivered at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, Dallas, Texas, July 10, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/waller20250710a.htm. 2 For details discussed below, see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2025), Statistical Release H.4.1, “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks” (October 9), https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20251009/h41.pdf."}

Reserves are the safest and most liquid asset in the financial system, and only the Fed can create them. The adequate provision of reserves is essential to the safety and soundness of our banking system, the resilience and efficiency of our payments system, and ultimately the stability of our economy. Third is the Treasury General Account (TGA), currently at about $800 billion, which essentially is the checking account for the federal government. When the Treasury makes or receives payments, those flows affect dollar-for-dollar the supply of reserves or other liabilities in the system. 3 The asset side of our ledger consists almost entirely of securities, including $4.2 trillion of U.S. Treasury securities and $2.1 trillion of government-guaranteed agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS).4 When we add reserves to the system, we generally do so by purchasing Treasury securities in the open market and crediting the reserve accounts of the banks involved in the transaction with the seller. This process effectively transforms securities held by the public into reserves but does not change the total amount of government liabilities held by the public.5 3 Other liabilities include reverse repurchase agreements and accounts held by designated financial market utilities, foreign central banks, and international financial institutions. 4 Within its securities portfolio, the Federal Reserves also holds $2.3 billion in government agency debt. 5 In 2021, the standing repo facility was established to serve as a backstop in money markets to support the effective implementation of monetary policy and smooth market functioning. It is available to provide liquidity to primary dealers and eligible depository institutions through overnight repurchase agreements. The Federal Reserve also maintains U.S. dollar liquidity swap lines with several major central banks to prevent strains in global dollar funding markets from spilling over into domestic markets. The Foreign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility also is a source of dollar liquidity for approved foreign central banks and international monetary authorities. Beyond securities, the Fed maintains lending facilities that serve as crucial backstops for the banking system. The loans we make through these facilities show up as assets on our balance sheet, with the corresponding liability typically being reserves. Our discount window provides no-questions-asked liquidity to eligible depository institutions. In unusual and exigent circumstances, we may establish emergency liquidity facilities, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. These facilities have demonstrated their critical importance in times of stress."}

When COVID-19 struck in March 2020, the economy came to a near standstill and financial markets seized up, threatening to transform a public health crisis into a severe, prolonged economic downturn. In response, we established a number of emergency liquidity facilities. Those programs, supported by Congress and the Administration, provided critical support to markets and were remarkably effective in restoring confidence and stability. At their peak in July 2020, loans from these facilities totaled just over $200 billion. Most of these loans were quickly unwound as conditions stabilized. 6 At the same time, the market for U.S. Treasury securities—normally the deepest, most liquid market in the world and the bedrock of the global financial system—was under extraordinary pressure and on the verge of collapse. We used large-scale purchases of securities to restore functionality to the Treasury market. Faced with unprecedented market dysfunction, the Fed purchased Treasury and agency securities at an extraordinary pace in March and April of 2020. These purchases supported the flow of credit to households and businesses and fostered more accommodative financial conditions to 6 The combined peak in balances across these facilities occurred in July 2020 at just above $200 billion, including loans totaling $2.5 billion by the Primary Dealer Credit Facility, $20.6 billion by the Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility, $68.1 billion by the Paycheck Protection Program Liquidity Facility (PPPLF), $12.8 billion by the Commercial Paper Funding Facility, $41.4 billion by the Corporate Credit Facilities, $37.5 billion by the Main Street Lending Program (MSLP), $16.1 billion by the Municipal Liquidity Facility, and $8.8 billion by the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2020), Statistical Release H.4.1, “Factors Affecting Reserve Balances of Depository Institutions and Condition Statement of Federal Reserve Banks” (July 2), https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h41/20200702. At present, the only remaining balances from the pandemic-era emergency lending facilities are $75 million in the PPPLF and $4.1 billion in the MSLP. All other emergency lending facilities have already been fully repaid."}

By June 2020, we slowed our purchase pace to a still substantial $120 billion per month. In December 2020, as the economic outlook remained highly uncertain, the FOMC said that we expected to maintain that pace of purchases “until substantial further progress has been made toward the Committee’s maximum employment and price stability goals.”8 That guidance provided assurance that the Fed would not prematurely withdraw support while the economic recovery remained fragile amid unprecedented conditions. We maintained that pace of asset purchases through October 2021. By then, it had become apparent that elevated inflation was not likely to go away without a strong monetary response. At our meeting in November 2021, we announced a phaseout of asset purchases. At our next meeting in December, we doubled the pace of the taper and said that asset purchases would conclude by mid-March of 2022. Over the entire period of purchases, our securities holdings increased by $4.6 trillion. A number of observers have raised questions, fairly enough, about the size and composition of asset purchases during the pandemic recovery. 9 Throughout 2020 and 7 See Jerome H.

{"file": "r251016b.pdf", "para_id": 4, "text": "- 5 - 2021, the economy continued to face significant challenges as successive waves of COVID caused widespread disruption and loss. During that tumultuous period, we continued purchases in order to avoid a sharp, unwelcome tightening of financial conditions at a time when the economy still appeared to be highly vulnerable. Our thinking was informed by recent episodes in which signals about reducing the balance sheet had triggered significant tightening in financial conditions. We were thinking of events of December 2018, as well as the 2013 “taper tantrum.” 10 Regarding the composition of our purchases, some have questioned the inclusion of agency MBS purchases given the strong housing market during the pandemic recovery. 11 Outside of purchases aimed specifically at market functioning, MBS purchases are primarily intended, like our purchases of Treasury securities, to ease broader financial conditions when the policy rate is constrained at the ELB. 12 The extent to which these MBS purchases disproportionately affected housing market conditions during this period is challenging to determine.

While multiple factors were in play, many market participants pointed to the description of the Fed’s quantitative tightening as being on “autopilot” as exacerbating the turmoil. The “taper tantrum” was a sharp market selloff in 2013 when Chair Ben Bernanke suggested the Fed might soon reduce its asset purchases, causing Treasury yields to spike and triggering volatility in financial markets. 11 See, for example, Aaron Klein and Alan Cui (2025), “Quantitative Easing and Housing Inflation Post- COVID,” Series on Financial Markets and Regulation, Brookings Center on Regulations and Markets, October 8, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/quantitative-easing-and-housing-inflation-post-covid. 12 See, for example, Chair Bernanke’s description of the operation of balance sheet tools as part of his discussion of monetary policy in the post–Global Financial Crisis (GFC) environment: Ben S. Bernanke (2012), “Monetary Policy since the Onset of the Crisis,” speech delivered at a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, held in Jackson Hole, Wyo., August 31, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/files/bernanke20120831a.pdf."}

Our real-time decisions were intended to serve as insurance against downside risks. We knew that we could unwind purchases relatively quickly once we ended them, which is exactly what we did. Research and experience tell us that asset purchases affect the economy through expectations regarding the future size and duration of our balance sheet. 14 When we announced our taper, market participants began pricing in its effects, pulling forward the tightening in financial conditions.15 Stopping sooner could have made some difference, but not likely enough to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the economy. Nonetheless, our experience since 2020 does suggest that we can be more nimble in our use of the balance sheet, and more confident that our communications will foster appropriate expectations among market participants given their growing experience with these tools. 13 Research indicates that house price increases during this time reflected factors well beyond mortgage rates. For example, Mondragon and Wieland (2022) estimate that the shift to remote work explains approximately one-half of the rise in house prices during the pandemic; for more details, see John A. Mondragon and Johannes Wieland (2022), “Housing Demand and Remote Work,” NBER Working Paper Series 30041 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bureau of Economic Research, May; revised May 2025), https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w30041/w30041.pdf. 14 See, for example, Mark Carlson, Stefania D’Amico, Cristina Fuentes-Albero, Bernd Schlusche, and Paul Wood (2020), “Issues in the Use of the Balance Sheet Tool,” Finance and Economics Discussion Series 2020-071 (Washington: Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, August), https://doi.org/10.17016/FEDS.2020.071. 15 Even before the taper in purchases was completed in 2022, markets were anticipating the rapid decline in the size of the balance sheet that we subsequently delivered. Those expectations were formed based on our communications, even though the anticipated pace was three times faster than our experience from 2017 to 2019. For example, the median respondents to the Survey of Primary Dealers in June 2022 anticipated that the size of the System Open Market Account (SOMA) portfolio would ultimately fall by more than $2 trillion in less than three years, from its mid-2022 level of $8.5 trillion to $6.25 trillion by 2025:Q1. See question 3b in the June 2022 dealer survey results: Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Markets Group (2022), “Responses to Survey of Primary Dealers,” June, https://www.newyorkfed.org/medialibrary/media/markets/survey/2022/jun-2022-spd-results.pdf."}

But I believe our statements were reasonably clear about our objectives, which were to support and then sustain smooth market functioning and to help foster accommodative financial conditions. Over time, the relative importance of those objectives evolved with economic conditions. But the objectives were never in conflict, so at the time this issue appeared to be a distinction without much of a difference. That is not always the case, of course. For example, the March 2023 banking stress led to a sizable increase in our balance sheet through lending operations. We clearly differentiated these financial stability operations from our monetary policy stance. Indeed, we continued to raise the policy rate through that time. Our Ample Reserves Framework Works Well Turning to my second topic, our ample reserves regime has proven highly effective, delivering good control of our policy rate across a wide range of challenging economic conditions, while promoting financial stability and supporting a resilient payments system. 17 16 See William B. English and Brian Sack (2024), “Challenges around the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Framework and Its Implementation,” Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Fall, pp. 3–26, https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/1.a_EnglishSack.pdf, as well as Donald Kohn (2025), “Fed Should Be Sure to Include Monetary Policy Tools in Forthcoming Framework Review,” Brookings Commentary, January 24, https://www.brookings.edu/articles/fed-should-be-sure-to-include- monetary-policy-tools-in-forthcoming-framework-review. 17 By contrast, before the GFC, the Fed implemented monetary policy through a fundamentally different approach, a scarce reserves regime. This system relied on complicated reserve requirements to stabilize reserve demand, as the Fed did not have the authority to pay interests on reserves. Because banks did not receive interest on reserves, they engaged in a variety of costly activities to minimize their reserve requirements. To hit the federal funds rate target, the Fed had to conduct daily open market operations to fine-tune reserve supply. That approach was operationally burdensome for both depository institutions and the Federal Reserve. It minimized systemwide liquidity consistent with the federal funds target rate, thus making the banking system more vulnerable to shocks. Unexpected swings in reserve demand at times led to excess volatility in short-term interest rates. In this scarce regime, banks relied more heavily on"}
{"file": "r251016b.pdf", "para_id": 7, "text": "- 8 - In this framework, an ample supply of reserves ensures adequate liquidity in the banking system, and control of our policy rate is achieved through the setting of our administered rates— interest on reserve balances and the overnight reverse repo rate. This approach allows us to maintain rate control independently of the size of our balance sheet. That is important given large, unpredictable swings in liquidity demand from the private sector and significant fluctuations in autonomous factors affecting reserve supply, such as the Treasury General Account. This framework has proven resilient whether the balance sheet is shrinking or growing. Since June 2022, we have reduced the size of our balance sheet by $2.2 trillion—from 35 percent to just under 22 percent of GDP —while maintaining effective interest rate control. 18 Our long-stated plan is to stop balance sheet runoff when reserves are somewhat above the level we judge consistent with ample reserve conditions.19 We may approach that point in coming months, and we are closely monitoring a wide range of indicators to inform this decision. 20 Some signs have begun to emerge that liquidity conditions are unsecured borrowing from other financial institutions— funding that can rapidly evaporate in times of stress, as was evident in the GFC. 18 In January 2022, the FOMC released its “Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,” followed in May by more detailed plans for doing so; see Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Principles for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,” press release, January 26, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220126c.htm; and Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (2022), “Plans for Reducing the Size of the Federal Reserve’s Balance Sheet,” May 4, press release, https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20220504b.htm. 19 Once balance sheet runoff has ceased, reserve balances will continue to gradually decline as other Federal Reserve liabilities grow over time. At some point, the Committee will determine that reserve balances have reached an appropriately ample level. Thereafter, the Committee will manage securities holdings as needed to maintain ample reserves over time. 20 While reserves appear to remain abundant, they are declining and will continue to do so. Since we began shrinking our balance sheet in 2022, the quantity of reserves has not changed much as the excess liquidity in the system was absorbed and then subsequently released by our overnight reverse repo facility. Now, however, balances in that facility have declined to minimal levels, so further declines in our securities holdings will translate more directly into lower reserves. Currently, reserve balances stand just below $3"}

The Committee’s plans lay out a deliberately cautious approach to avoid the kind of money market strains experienced in September 2019. Moreover, the tools of our implementation framework, including the standing repo facility and the discount window, will help contain funding pressures and keep the federal funds rate within our target range through this transition to lower reserve levels. Normalizing the size of our balance sheet does not mean going back to the balance sheet we had before the pandemic. In the longer run, the size of our balance sheet is determined by the public’s demand for our liabilities rather than our pandemic-related asset purchases. Non-reserve liabilities currently stand about $1.1 trillion higher than just prior to the pandemic, thus requiring that our securities holdings be equally higher. Demand for reserves has risen as well, in part reflecting the growth of the banking system and the overall economy. Regarding the composition of our securities portfolio, relative to the outstanding universe of Treasury securities, our portfolio is currently overweight longer-term securities and underweight shorter-term securities. The longer-run composition will be a topic of Committee discussion. Transition to our desired composition will occur gradually and predictably, giving market participants time to adjust and minimizing the risk of market disruption. Consistent with our longstanding guidance, we aim for a portfolio consisting primarily of Treasury securities over the longer run. 21 trillion, or about 10 percent of GDP. By comparison, reserves as a share of GDP stood near 8 percent of GDP in early 2019, prior to the acute funding pressures that emerged later that year. Note that reserves as a share of GDP is merely indicative, not a measure of the ampleness of reserves. Assessments of where reserves stand relative to ample levels depend on a wide range of market indicators. 21 As noted in the minutes of the May 2022 FOMC meeting, the Committee could, at some point, consider sales of agency MBS to accelerate progress toward a longer-run SOMA portfolio composed primarily of Treasury securities; see Federal Open Market Committee (2022), “Minutes of the Federal Open Market"}

The Fed earns interest income from the Treasury securities that back reserves. Most of the time, our interest earnings from Treasury holdings more than cover the interest paid on reserves, generating significant remittances to the Treasury. By law, we remit all profits to the Treasury after covering expenses. Since 2008, even after accounting for the recent period of negative net income, our total remittances to Treasury have totaled more than $900 billion. While our net interest income has temporarily been negative due to the rapid rise in policy rates to control inflation, this is highly unusual. Our net income will soon turn positive again, as it typically has been throughout our history. Of course, having negative net income has no bearing on our ability to conduct monetary policy or meet our financial obligations. 22 If our ability to pay interest on reserves and other liabilities were eliminated, the Fed would lose control over rates. The stance of monetary policy would no longer be appropriately calibrated to economic conditions and would push the economy away from our employment and price stability goals. To restore rate control, large sales of securities over a short period of time would be needed to shrink our balance sheet and the quantity of reserves in the system. The volume and speed of these sales could strain Treasury market functioning and compromise financial stability.

Even after that volatile and disruptive process, the banking system would be less resilient and more vulnerable to liquidity shocks. The bottom line is that our ample reserves regime has proven remarkably effective for implementing monetary policy and supporting economic and financial stability. Current Economic Conditions and Monetary Policy Outlook I will close with a brief discussion of the economy and the outlook for monetary policy. Although some important government data have been delayed due to the shutdown, we routinely review a wide variety of public- and private-sector data that have remained available. We also maintain a nationwide network of contacts through the Reserve Banks who provide valuable insights, which will be summarized in tomorrow’s Beige Book. Based on the data that we do have, it is fair to say that the outlook for employment and inflation does not appear to have changed much since our September meeting four weeks ago. Data available prior to the shutdown, however, show that growth in economic activity may be on a somewhat firmer trajectory than expected. While the unemployment rate remained low through August, payroll gains have slowed sharply, likely in part due to a decline in labor force growth due to lower immigration and labor force participation. In this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen. While official employment data for September are delayed, available evidence suggests that both - 12 - layoffs and hiring remain low, and that both households’ perceptions of job availability and firms’ perceptions of hiring difficulty continue their downward trajectories.23 Meanwhile, 12-month core PCE inflation was 2.9 percent in August, up slightly from earlier this year, as rising core goods inflation has outpaced continued disinflation in housing services. Available data and surveys continue to show that goods price increases primarily reflect tariffs rather than broader inflationary pressures. Consistent with these effects, near-term inflation expectations have generally increased this year, while most longer-term expectation measures remain aligned with our 2 percent goal. Rising downside risks to employment have shifted our assessment of the balance of risks. As a result, we judged it appropriate to take another step toward a more neutral policy stance at our September meeting. There is no risk-free path for policy as we navigate the tension between our employment and inflation goals. This challenge was evident in the dispersion of Committee participants’ projections at the September meeting. I will stress again that these projections should be understood as representing a range of potential outcomes whose probabilities evolve as new information informs our meeting-by-meeting approach to policymaking. We will set policy based on the evolution of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, rather than following a predetermined path. Thank you again for this award and for inviting me to join you today. I look forward to our conversation. 23 State-level data on unemployment insurance claims during September remain available, as do some non- governmental statistics on job openings and hiring. September results regarding perceptions of employment conditions by firms and households are also available from recurring surveys, such as the National Federation of Independent Business’s Jobs Report and the Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Survey."}

{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 166, "text": "(Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question, and congratulations on another outstanding quarter."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 167, "text": "And if I’m looking at Microsoft, this is two quarters in a row, we’re really seeing results that are well ahead of anybody’s expectations when we were thinking about this company a year ago or five years ago. 111% commercial bookings growth was not on anybody’s bingo card, if you will. Yet, the stock is underperforming the broader market."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 168, "text": "And the question I have is getting at the zeitgeist that I think is weighing on the stock, and it is something about to change. And I think AGI is a nomenclature or shorthand for that, and it’s something that’s still included in your guys’ OpenAI agreement."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 169, "text": "Satya, when we think about AGI, or we think about how application and computing architectures are changing, is there anything that you see on the horizon, whether it’s AGI or something else, that could potentially change what appears to be a really strong positioning for Microsoft in the marketplace today, where that strength will perhaps weaken on a go-forward basis? Is there anything that you’re worrying about in that evolution, and particularly the evolution of these generative AI models?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 170, "text": "SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. Here’s how I would say that I think there are two parts we feel very, very good about, even this, I’d say, the new agreement that we now have with OpenAI, because I think even, it just creates more certainty to all the IP relationship we have as it relates to even this definition of AGI."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 171, "text": "But beyond that, I think your question touches on something that’s pretty important, which is, how are these AI systems going to truly be deployed in the real world and make a real difference and make a return for both the customers who are deploying them and then obviously, the providers of these systems?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 172, "text": "And I think the best way to characterize the situation is that even as the intelligence capability increases, let’s even say, exponentially, model version over model version, the problem is, it’s always going to still be jagged. I think the term people use is the jagged intelligence or spikey intelligence. You may even have a capability that’s fantastic at a particular task, but it may not uniformly grow."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 173, "text": "What is required is, in fact, these systems, whether it is GitHub Agent HQ or the M365 Copilot system. Don’t think of this as a product. Think of it as a system that, in some sense, smooths out those jagged edges and really helps the capability."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 174, "text": "I mean, just to give you a flavor for it, if I am in M365 Copilot, I can generate an Excel spreadsheet. The good news is, now an expert spreadsheet does understand Office JS, has the formulas in it. It feels like, wow, it is a great spreadsheet created by a good model."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 175, "text": "The more interesting thing is, I can go into Agent Mode in Excel and iterate on that model, and yet it’ll stay on rails. It won’t go off rails. It’ll be able to do the iteration. Then I can even give it to the Analyst agent, and then it’ll even make sense of it like a data analyst would, of our Excel model."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 176, "text": "The reason I say all of that is because that’s the type of construction that will be needed. Even when the model is magical, all powerful, I think we will be in this jagged intelligence phase for a long time."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 177, "text": "One of the fundamental things that, whether it’s GitHub, whether it’s security, whether it’s M365, the three main domains we are in, we feel very, very good about building these as organizing layers for agents to help customers."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 178, "text": "And by the way, that’s the same thing that we want to put into Foundry for our third-party customers. That’s how people will build these multiagent systems."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 179, "text": "I feel actually, pretty good about both the progress in AI. I don’t think AGI, as defined, at least, by us in our contract, is ever going to be achieved anytime soon, but I do believe we can drive a lot of value for customers with advances in AI models by building these systems. It’s the real question that needs to be well understood, and I feel very, very confident about our ability to make progress."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 180, "text": "KEITH WEISS: Excellent. That’s super helpful."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 181, "text": "JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 182, "text": "(Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Amy, on the bookings blow out, I guess many are somewhat concerned about concentration risk. And I think you noted a number of $100 million contracts. And not to go into a lot of detail, but can you just give a sense of what you’re seeing in that 51% RPO and 110%-plus bookings growth that gives you confidence about what you’re seeing in terms of the breadth and extent of some of these deals on a global basis. Thanks."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 183, "text": "AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. A couple things to maybe take a step back on RPO. With a nearly $400 billion balance, we’ve been trying to help people understand how to think about, really the breadth of that. It covers numerous products. It covers customers of all sizes. And that’s been a balance that we’ve been growing, obviously, at a good clip."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 184, "text": "But what people need to realize is it sits across multiple products because of the things Satya’s talking about around creating systems and where we’re investing. And if you’re going to have that type of balance, and then, more importantly, have the weighted average duration be two years, it means that most of that is being consumed in relatively short order."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 185, "text": "People are not consuming, and I say this broadly, unless there’s value. And I think this is why we keep coming back to are we creating real-world value in our AI platforms, in our AI solutions and apps and systems?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 186, "text": "And so, I think the way to think about RPO is it’s been building across a number of customers. We’re thrilled to have OpenAI be a piece of that. We’re learning a ton and building leading systems because of it that are being used at scale, that benefits every other customer."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 187, "text": "And so, it’s why we’ve tried to get a little bit more color to that RPO balance, because I do understand that there have been a lot of concerns or questions about, is it long dated? Is it coming over a long period of time? And hopefully, this is helpful for people to realize that these are contracts being signed by customers who intend to use it in relatively short order. And at that type of scale, I think that’s a pretty remarkable execution."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 188, "text": "JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 189, "text": "(Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking my question, and congratulations on the quarter. It’s pretty amazing, what you guys are doing."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 190, "text": "Satya and Amy, I’d like to ask you the number one question I receive, whether from investors or at AI conferences I attend. How much confidence do you have that the software, even the consumer internet business can monetize all the investments we’re seeing globally, or, frankly, are we in a bubble?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 191, "text": "In fact, Amy, what would be the factors you’d be watching for to assure that you’re not over building for current demand and that demand will sustain? Thank you."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 192, "text": "AMY HOOD: Maybe I’ll start, Satya, and then you could add."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 193, "text": "Let me talk a little bit about maybe connecting a couple of the dots, because with $400 billion of RPO that’s short dated, as we talked about, our needs to continue to build out the infrastructure is very high. And that’s for booked business today. That is not any new book to business we started trying to accomplish on October 1st."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 194, "text": "And so, the way to think about that, and you saw it this quarter in particular and as we talked about ‘26, the remainder, number one, we’re pivoting toward, increasingly, we talked about this, short lived assets, both GPUs and CPUs. Again, we talk about all these workloads are burning both in terms of app building."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 195, "text": "Now, when that happens short-lived assets generally are done to match the duration of the contracts, or the duration of your expectation of those contracts. And so, I sometimes think when people think about risk, they’re not realizing that most of the lifetimes of these and the lifetimes of the contracts are very similar. And so, when you think about having revenue and the bookings and coming on the balance sheet and the depreciation of short lived assets, they’re actually quite matched, Mark."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 196, "text": "And as you know, we’ve spent the past few years not actually being short GPUs and CPUs per se, we were short the space or the power, is the language we use, to put them in. We spent a lot of time building out that infrastructure. Now, we’re continuing to do that, also using leases. Those are very long-lived assets, as we’ve talked about, 15 to 20 years. And over that period of time, do I have confidence that we’ll need to use all of that? It is very high."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 197, "text": "And so, when I think about balancing those things, seeing the pivot to GPUs, CPUs, short lived, seeing the pivot in terms of how those are being utilized, we are, and I said this now, we’ve been short now for many quarters. I thought we were going to catch up. We are not. Demand is increasing. It is not increasing in just one place. It is increasing across many places. We’re seeing usage increases in products. We are seeing new products launch that are getting increasing usage, and increasing uses very quickly. When people see real value, they actually commit real usage."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 198, "text": "And I sometimes think this is where this cycle needs to be thought through completely, is that you know when you see these demand signals, and we know we’re behind, we do need to spend. But we’re spending with a different amount of confidence in usage patterns and in bookings, and I feel very good about that."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 199, "text": "I have said we are now likely to be short capacity to serve the most important things we need to do, which is Azure, our first-party applications. We need to invest in product R&D, and we’re doing end-of-life replacements in the fleet. We’re going to spend to make sure that happens. It’s about modernization. It’s about high quality. It’s about service delivery, and it’s about meeting demand."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 200, "text": "And so, I feel good about doing that, and I feel good that we’ve been able to do it so efficiently and with a growing book of business behind it."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 201, "text": "SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, the only thing I would add to what Amy captured was, if you look out, there are two things that matter, I think, and that are critical in terms of how we think about our allocation of capital, also our R&D."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 202, "text": "One is, how efficient is our planet scale token factory? I mean, that’s, at the end of the day, what you have to do. And you in order to do that, you have to start with building out a very fungible fleet. It’s not like we’re building one data center in one region in the world that’s mega scale. We’re building it out across the globe for inference, for pre-training, for post-training, for RL, for datacenter, what have you. Therefore, the fungibility is super important."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 203, "text": "The second thing that we’re also doing is continually modernizing the fleet. It’s not like we buy one version of, say, Nvidia and load up for all the gigawatts we have. Each year, your buy; you write the Moore’s Law. You continuously modernize and depreciate it. And that means you also use software to grow efficiency. I talked about, I think, 30% improvement on both serving up GPT-41 and 5o. That’s software."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 204, "text": "And by the way, it’s helpful on A100s. It’s helpful on GB200s, and it’ll be helpful on GB300s. That’s the beauty of having the efficiency of the fleet."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 205, "text": "Keep improving utilization, keep improving the efficiency. That’s what you do in the token factory."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 206, "text": "The other aspect, which Amy spoke to, is we have some of the best agent systems that matter in the high value domains. It’s in information work. That’s the Copilot system. Coding, I mean, I should also say, one of the things I like about Copilot is, I mean, Copilot ARPUs compared to M365 ARPUs, it’s expansive. The same thing that happened between server and cloud, we used to always say, “Well, is it zero sum?” It turned out that the cloud was so much more expansive to the server market."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 207, "text": "The same thing is happening in AI, because first, you could say, hey, our ARPUs are too low when it comes to M365, or you could say, we have the opportunity with AI to be much more expansive."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 208, "text": "Same thing with tools. I mean, tooling, this tools business was not a leading business, whereas coding business is going to be one of the most expansive AI systems. And so, we feel very good about being in that category. Same thing with security, same thing with health."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 209, "text": "And in consumer, one of the things is it’s not just about ads, it’s ads plus subscriptions. That also opens up opportunity for us."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 210, "text": "When I look at the entirety of these high value agent systems, and when we look at the efficiency of and fungibility of our fleet, that’s what gives us the confidence to invest both the capital and the R&D talent to go after this opportunity."}

{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 214, "text": "Amy, I certainly don’t want to take you down too complex an accounting path with this question. But the investment in OpenAI that sits another income at $4.1 billion is so large that I think the audience listening in could benefit from a little bit more color about what that is. It feels like it’s so much larger than you were running through other income in prior quarters that it mustn’t just be your share of the OpenAI losses."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 215, "text": "Could you just describe that and what we can expect in subsequent quarters, and whether this signals any kind of accounting change? Thanks so much."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 216, "text": "AMY HOOD: The Q1 number was not impacted at all by the new agreement that was put in place. Let me first say that. Secondly, that increased loss was all due to our percentage of losses and OpenAI equity method, just to be very clear. There is not anything there that is not the increased losses from OpenAI."}

{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 219, "text": "(Operator Direction.) MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you so much. We seem to be entering into a new era where the contractual commitments from a small number of AI natives are just incredibly large, and not only at absolute terms, but sometimes relative to the size of the companies themselves, for instance, contracts worth hundreds of billions of dollars that are 20 times their current revenue scale."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 220, "text": "Philosophically, how do you evaluate the ability of those companies to follow through on these commitments? And how do you think about placing guardrails on customer concentration for any single entity?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 221, "text": "SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll start and then, Amy, you can add."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 222, "text": "I mean, it goes back a little bit, Mark, to what I said about building first the asset itself such that it’s most fungible, and then to recognize the strength of even our portfolio. We have a third-party business. We have a first-party business. We have third party also spread between enterprise, digital natives."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 223, "text": "I’ve always felt that we need a balance there, because it may start with digital natives. They’re always going to be the early adopters. You always have the hit app of the generation, and then, essentially, it spreads throughout. The enterprise adoption cycle is just starting."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 224, "text": "And so, therefore, having over the arc of time, I think that third-party balance of customers will only increase. But it’s great to have the hit first-party apps in the beginning, because you can build scale that then, it’s a fungible. And that’s where the key is. You don’t want to build for a digital native as if you’re just doing hosting for them. You want to build."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 225, "text": "That’s where I think some of the decision making of ours is probably getting better understood. What do we say yes to? What do we say no to? I think there was a lot of confusion. Hopefully, by now, anyone who’s switched on would figure this out."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 226, "text": "And so, that’s, I think, one thing we’re doing on the third party, but the one first-party is probably where a lot of our leverage comes. And it’s not even about one hit app on our first party, even. Our portfolio of stuff, which I just walked through in the earlier answer, gives us, again, the confidence that between that mix, we will be able to use our fleet to the maximum."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 227, "text": "And remember, these assets, especially the data centers and so on, are long assets. There will be many refresh cycles for any one of these when it comes to the gear."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 228, "text": "I feel that once you think about all those dimensions, the concentration risk gets mitigated by being thoughtful about how you really ensure the build is for the broad customer base."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 229, "text": "AMY HOOD: And maybe just to help with another angle, because I think Satya has helped a lot, is that when you think about concentration risk or delivering to any customer, you have to remember that, because we’re talking about this very large, flexible fleet that can be used for anyone and for any purpose, 1P, 3P, and including our commercial cloud, by the way, which I should be quite clear on, it is pretty flexible in every regard, you have to remember that the CPU and GPU and the storage gear doesn’t come into play until the contracts start happening."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 230, "text": "And so, you’re right. Some of these large contracts have delivery dates over time, so you get a lot of lead time in being able to say, oh, what’s the status? And so, I think we’re pretty thoughtful around what’s always gone in our RPO balance, and been considerate of that. There’s always been that taken into account when we publish that bookings number and publish the RPO balance."}

{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 233, "text": "(Operator Direction.) BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Great. Thanks so much for taking the question, and I’ll echo my congrats on an amazing start to the year."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 234, "text": "Amy, is there any way to quantify or frame the revenue impact of Azure being short on capacity? And while I appreciate the constraints you face are brought across the industry, is there risk of workloads going elsewhere, and how do you mitigate that?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 235, "text": "AMY HOOD: Yeah, Brad, it’s a great question. It’s always hard to quantify precisely what would have been the revenue impact in quarter, but I would offer a way to think about it, is Azure probably does bear most of the revenue impact, because when you think about real priorities that you have to fill first, it’s obviously the increasing usage and adoption and sales we’ve seen of M365 Copilot and the usage of Copilot Chat, which we’ve seen very different patterns, which we’re encouraged by. It’s the adoption of security features. It’s the GitHub momentum."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 236, "text": "And so, when you’re thinking about it, that is where, and it is a priority for us to allocate resourcing there first. And so, you are right to ask, how do I think about that? We’ve worked very hard to try to mitigate it as best we can, but we have been short in Azure. And we’ve been clear on it."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 237, "text": "And I would say the other two priorities that I haven’t mentioned maybe as much before, it’s also just making sure our product teams and the AI talent that we’ve been able to hire into the company, really, over the past year and a half, have access also to significant capacity, because we’re seeing it make the product better in a loop that is adding great benefit today, into products people are using today for real-world work."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 238, "text": "And so, we are making that a priority to make sure our research teams have that as well as our product engineering teams. And yes, it does impact Azure directly. That is the place where you see that prioritization, but I think it’s probably hard for me to give an exact number. But it is safe to say that the number could be higher."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 239, "text": "JONATHAN NEILSON: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 240, "text": "(Operator Direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 241, "text": "Amy, I just wanted to congratulate you. I think you said before that it is possible to accelerate Azure growth while getting efficient margins, and you’ve done it. Congrats on that."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 242, "text": "I have one for you, Satya. With respect to the elephant in the room, just being a little bit more direct, following up on Keith Weiss’ question, there’s talk that another hyperscaler came in and took away the business that was rightfully Microsoft’s. I’m sure that there is a different point of view here."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 243, "text": "I’m wondering if you could offer some perspective on your criteria to, is it about a certain volume of business that you wish to execute on the Microsoft paper, or something broader than that, that I don’t think maybe people fully appreciate the terminal value that Microsoft will have on its balance sheet at the end of these contracts, which I think is probably being underestimated, as you have the full stack and you’ve got the multiple vectors to monetize, be it databases, Foundry, and to your point, that you are a platform company, not just a hyperscaler?"}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 244, "text": "Maybe that’s what it is all about, or maybe there’s another story about you letting the other hyperscaler company come in from nowhere, and claiming a big piece of that four-to-five-year puzzle. Thank you so much once again, really appreciate it, and congratulations."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 245, "text": "SATYA NADELLA: Well, thanks, Kash. I mean, for us, again, it just always goes back to, I think, the core principle, which is build a fleet that is fungible across the planet and works for third-party and first-party and research. That’s essentially what we have done."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 246, "text": "And so, when some demand comes in shapes that don’t fit that goal, where it’s too concentrated, not just by customer, by location, by type of skewing, I think Amy mentioned some very key things, when you think about the margin profile of a hyperscaler, you’ve got to remember this the AI accelerator piece. But there’s compute, there’s storage. And if so, if all of the demand just comes for just one meter, that’s really not a long-term business we want to be in."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 247, "text": "That’s even from a third party. We have to balance it with all of our first-party stuff, because that’s, after all, a different margin stack for us. And then we have to fund our own R&D and model capability, because in the long run, that’s what’s going to differentiate us."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 248, "text": "And so, I look at all of those, we use all of that to make sure we are saying yes to all the demand that we want. We say no to some of the demand that may be something that we could serve, but it’s not in our long-term interest. And so, that’s the decision making we’ve done, and we feel very, very good about the decisions. In some sense, I feel even each time we say no to, the day after, I feel better."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 249, "text": "KASH RANGAN: That’s fantastic, very clear."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 250, "text": "AMY HOOD: Yeah. And Kash, I think this is our last call with you, and I just want to say thanks and congratulations. It’s been a privilege to work with you, and best of luck."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 251, "text": "SATYA NADELLA: Let me add to that. Best of luck, Kash."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 252, "text": "KASH RANGAN: Thank you so much. Very kind of you."}
{"file": "TranscriptFY26Q1.docx", "para_id": 253, "text": "That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon."}
